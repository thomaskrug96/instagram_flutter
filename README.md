# instagram_flutter

Instagram clone using Flutter + Firebase
- User authentication method including email + password signup/login/logout
- Add posts with photos/descriptions and like/comment on other posts
- Streams added to see updated content in real time across devices
- Search functionality provided using Firebase search plugin

NOTE: I have deleted the Firebase backend for this project. The id's listed in the iOS/Android files will not work for you.

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repo
2. Install dependencies in pubspec.yaml
3. Create new Firebase project. Follow steps to create iOS, Android and Web apps under firebase project (You WILL need to edit iOS Runner in Xcode, and Gradle files in Android to properly use this code for your own implementation!)
